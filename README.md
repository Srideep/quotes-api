# quotes-api
Simple Backend API which I wrote in Node.js displaying REST API protocol/services.

This back-end script is using Node.js as its main framework in implementing web services through REST API protocol.
This short project helped me in understanding fundamental concepts of back-end web development using Node.js Framework.

I learned the following :
1.  Primary components of a web application.
2.  Responsibilities of a back-end developer.
3.  HTTP and how it is used in Web communication.
4.  RESTful APIs and services.
