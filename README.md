# quotes-api
Simple Backend API which I wrote in Node.js to learn about REST API protocol/services.

This back-end script is a part of an online course presented on edX platform named 'Building Functional Prototypes using Node.js'
This short online course helped me in understanding fundamental concepts of back-end web development using Node.js Framework.

I learned the following at the end of course :
1.  Primary components of a web application.
2.  Responsibilities of a back-end developer.
3.  HTTP and how it is used in Web communication.
4.  RESTful APIs and services.
