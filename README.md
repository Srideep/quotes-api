# Quotes API
Simple Backend API which I wrote in Node.js displaying REST API protocol/services.

This back-end script is using Node.js as its main framework in implementing web services through REST API protocol.
This short project helped me in understanding fundamental concepts of back-end web development using Node.js Framework.

The following objectives were acheived in this project :
1.  A simpe relational database implemented for storing quotations as text using sqllite.
2.  Express library of Node.js used for initiating web services api in REST protocol.
3.  Application configured and deployed on a local machine listening to a local port.
4.  Application tested succesfully through API calls on the listening port of the deployed enviroment.
